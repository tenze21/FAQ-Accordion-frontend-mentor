## Overview
In this project i have designed an accordion for frequently asked questions (FAQs), which almost matches the design provided by frontend mentor. It was a bit challenging especially while emplementing the dynamics in javascript, I really enjoyed doing the project.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
firstly as i usually do i went through the challenge and spend sometime trying to recreate a the project in my mind asking myself how I would make things work. Then i started off with the html file later styling it with css and then finally implenting the dynamics in javascript which took a while for me.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

As with all projects I learned a lot from this project especially in implementing the dynamic logic which was the most challenging and interesting part for me. I realised that i could use conditional statements to check how a code block was styled and make it function accordingly.

`function showHideAnswer1(){
    if(show1.style.display==='block'){
        ans1.style.display='none';
    }else{
        ans1.style.display='block';
    }
}`


### Continued development

some animation effects could be added when the answer is viewed in the FAQ accordion to make it more interactive.
